# Dog Identification App

## Project Description
This project serves as my capstone project for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program, The project aims to classify images of dogs according to their breed using state-of-the-art CNN models. If a human is detected, It will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.
 
Finally, A web app was developed to allow users to upload new images as input to detect the corresponding dog breed.

For better understanding of the project, please read [Dog_App] (https://github.com/mbahaay/Dog-Identification-App/blob/main/Dog_App.ipynb)

## Installation
Python 3.6 or above should be used, youâ€™ll need to use Jupyter Notebook and install the following libraries:

1.	numpy
2. sklearn
3. glob
4. random
5. keras
6. tensorflow
7. OpenCV
8. dash
9. matplotlib
10. base64
11. os
